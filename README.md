<h2>Web Stack and Explanation</h2>
<br/>
<p><strong>NextJS:</strong> My last project was based on React but this website is developed using NextJS. The reason for using NextJS is that it is simple to implement and comes with many added features. Some features that I have implemented are:
<br/>
<ul>
<li>File-system based routing: I have added all files that need routing under pages.

<li>

</ul>
<br/>
<p><strong>Bootstrap 5:</strong>
<ul>
<li> It was easy to implement a responsive layout using bootstrap components and classes (Flexbox and Grid).

<li>I have also used bootstrap icons.

<h1>Name and Description</h1>
<p><strong>Portfolio Website:</strong> This is my personal website showcasing some of my recent work</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Purpose and Goal</h2>
<br/>
<p>I wanted to upgrade my existing website and make it more modern/polished. </p>
<p>I have tried to implement some of my new learnings into this website, like for fetching and displaying my blogs, I have used meduim APIs and I have integrated the 'say hello/collaborate with me' form with google sheets</p>

<h2>Web Stack and Explanation</h2>
<br/>
<p><strong>NextJS:</strong> My last project was based on React but this website is developed using framework NextJS. The reason for using this framework is that it is simple to implement and comes with many added features. Some of which are:
<br/>
<ul>
<li>File-system based routing: I have added all files that need routing under pages.

<p><strong>Bootstrap 5:</strong> Its was ease to implement a responsive layout using bootstrap components and classes.
